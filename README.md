DSA using Python Notes 
# 📘 100 Days of DSA - Day 01

## 🔍 Topic: Analysis of Algorithms

### 📖 Summary

On **Day 01**, I studied the fundamentals of **algorithm analysis**, including time and space complexity, Big O notation, and types of cases (best, average, worst). These are essential for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms and understanding their performance at scale.

### 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- What is Algorithm Analysis?
- Why Analysis Matters in Software Development
- Time Complexity and Space Complexity
- Big O Notation:
  - `O(1)`, `O(n)`, `O(log n)`, `O(n log n)`, `O(n²)`, etc.
- Case Analysis:
  - Best, Average, Worst Cases
- Asymptotic Analysis
- Real-world Examples (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Types of Algorithm Analysis:
  - Theoretical, Empirical, Amortized

### 📄 Notes

I've created a structured, easy-to-understand PDF with all the key points and examples from today's learning.

### ✅ Outcome

- Gained clarity on how to evaluate and compare algorithm efficiency.
- Created reference notes for future review and coding practice.
